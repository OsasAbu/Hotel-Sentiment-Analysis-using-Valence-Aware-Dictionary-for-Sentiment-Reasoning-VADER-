# Hotel-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Valence-Aware-Dictionary-for-Sentiment-Reasoning-VADER-

### The objective of this project is to apply text mining and sentiment analysis on the reviews of hotels and restaurants utilising the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer within the NLTK suite in Python. The results obtained from the analysis can give an insight into how sentiment varies across different hotels, or restaurants. A world cloud was also created.
